# VidSum-AI

1. Developed a web application for video summarization using Flask and which would transcript and summarize the videos.
2. Used OpenAi Whisper for transcription and **fine-Tuned BART** for Video **summarization** 
3. Evaluated the performance of algorithm using metric  **BLEU and ROUGE** score to campare the performance with state of the art Video summarization Technology
4. Made it easier for users to understand the content of the video with minimal effort
5. Develped a **Audio based** upon the video summary to understnad the evasily our complete summary 


## Features:
**Video Transcription:** users can upload video files or provide video linkes and our application will transcribe the video into text.
